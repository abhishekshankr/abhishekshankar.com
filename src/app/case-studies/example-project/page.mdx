# Project Name: Design System

## Overview

This case study explores the development of a comprehensive design system for a large-scale application.

### The Challenge

Creating a consistent, scalable design language that could be used across multiple platforms and products.

### The Solution

We developed a modular design system using:

- React components
- Tailwind CSS
- Storybook for documentation
- Automated testing

```tsx
// Example component from the design system
export function Button({ children, variant = 'primary' }) {
  return (
    <button className={`btn btn-${variant}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

### Impact

- 40% reduction in design inconsistencies
- 60% faster component development
- Improved collaboration between design and development teams

### Technologies Used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Storybook
- Jest
- React Testing Library
